  "If you don't like your destiny, don't accept it."

  "...it's not luck, it's training, effort until the end..."
  
  "The impossible does not exist! The limits only exist if you let them exist! ... Moved by challenges I never despair, and don't say I can't achieve what I want, because my willpower is the size of the universe."
  
  ## About me
  Currently, I am a full stack developer, focusing on front end development. When developing my applications my focus is to transform ideas into functional, attractive and responsive interfaces.
  
  My front end development stack is based on Next.js, Sass and TypeScript. With this stack I build modern and efficient applications. I am always aiming to understand user behavior to provide the best experience when accessing my applications.
  
  On the back end, I use Django to create robust and scalable solutions, ensuring that the system works in the best way possible in conjunction with the front end.
